# [Complete Intersection Singularities] (@id ICIS_sing)

A space germ $(X,x) \subseteq ({\mathbb C}^n,x)$ of dimension $d$ is called a complete 
intersection, if the ideal $I$ of its local ring ${\mathcal O}_{(X,x)} = {\mathcal O}_{({\mathbb C}^n,x)}/I$ can be generated by a ${\mathcal O}_{({\mathbb C}^n,0)}$-regular sequence of length $n-d$, i.e. by $f_1,\dots,f_{n-d} \in {\mathcal O}_{({\mathbb C}^n,0)}$ such that $f_i$ is not a zero-divisor of ${\mathcal O}_{({\mathbb C}^n,0)}/\langle f_1,\dots,f_{i-1}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n-d$.

As explaind in
section [Generalities on Space Germs](@ref space_germ_generalities), the need for exact computations forces OSCAR
to restrict all considerations to the subring of those representable by means 
of an element of the localization of an affine scheme at a point. Where no other reference is specified, we refer the reader to the textbooks [Loo84](@cite) and [GLS07](@cite). Note that general functionality for space germs is available for ICIS germs, but not mentioned here unless a more efficient variant is available in this setting.

In general, the notion of equivalence for complete intersection singularities is **contact** **equivalence**, i.e. isomorphism of space germs. Unless certain functionality depends on a chosen regular sequence defining the ICIS germ, all functionality will be provided both for SpaceGerm and for a vector of ring elements encoding the regular sequence.
